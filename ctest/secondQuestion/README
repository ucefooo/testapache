# Fibonacci Number Implementations

This repository contains three different implementations to calculate Fibonacci numbers in C. The goal is to explore various approaches to solving the Fibonacci sequence efficiently.

## Development Environment

- Programming Language: C
- Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Operating System: MacOs
- Text Editor/IDE: VS code
- dependecies : Makefile

## Compilation and Execution

The implementations are provided in separate C source code files. You can use the included Makefile to easily compile and run each implementation.

### Choose an Option

To compile and run a specific implementation, use the following make commands:

- `make runFirst` for the recursiveFibo implementation
- `make runSecond` for the memorizationFibo implementation
- `make runThird` for the iterativeFibo implementation

For example, to run the recursiveFibo implementation:

    ```make runFirst```


### Clean Up

To clean up the compiled executables, use the following make command:

    ```make clean```


## Usage

Running each make command will compile and execute the respective Fibonacci implementation. You'll see the output for Fibonacci numbers calculated using different approaches, including recursive, memorization, and iterative methods.
