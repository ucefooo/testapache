## HOW TO RUN

you need to run this command: 

    ```node indMissingNumber.js```

## HOW TO TEST 

I already provided and example all you need to is change the value of `n` here :
    `for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++)` for array numbers 
    ```numbers.splice(x, 1);```  change `X` with the number you want to delete.
