# Arithmetic Expression Calculator

This program demonstrates a simple arithmetic expression calculator implemented in C. It supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and Fibonacci sequence generation.

## Development Environment

- Programming Language: C
- Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- Operating System: MacOs
- Text Editor/IDE: VS code

## How to Compile and Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code files using the `cd` command:

    ```cd path/to/source/code```


3. Compile the source code using GCC. Run the following command:

    ```gcc -o calculator calculator.c```

This will generate an executable file named `calculator`.

4. Run the compiled executable:

    ```./calculator```


The program will execute and display the results of various arithmetic operations and Fibonacci sequence generation.

## Usage

Upon running the program, you'll see the output for the predefined arithmetic operations and Fibonacci sequence. The program uses function pointers to create nodes representing different operations and values. The `calc` function is responsible for evaluating and displaying the results.

## Sample Output

The program will display the following output:

    ```
        add: 56
        mul: 28
        sub: -28
        fibo: 0
    ```
